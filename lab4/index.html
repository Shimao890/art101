		//For each plaer, generates 5 ships with different sizes.

	//Players call out coordinates on the grid

	//If the player guesses wrong.
		//Then the opponent calls out miss, and the game continues.


	//If a player guesses correct.

	//Each ship has a certain aloted hit count
		//If hit count is full, then the ship sinks
