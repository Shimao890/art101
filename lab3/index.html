		<p>The sbuject of the lab is to learn file structures in the PC and is also
			about transfer a file to Github.
		</p>
		<p> The difficulty I encountered is to familarize with the HTML syntax.
			  Also, because the html file name is the same for the homepage file
				and the lab file. It's kind of difficult to locate the file I need.
