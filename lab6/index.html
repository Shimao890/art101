	<h1>Arrays and Objects<h1>
  <h2>challenge</h2>
   <p>We had to mess arround to define the arrays and refrencing elements in the
		 JS console. We had to learn how to clasify and organzie things in JS
		 console and learned how to include it into our html page.
	 	</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
   <p>I'm not too familar with the use of the console. You need to do Shift
		  and a return to do a normal return on an editor. Also, the print statement
			contains many parts like  the "br" means a break and "/t" is to print in
			another line.
	 </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The following is the result.</p>
	<div>
			 <h2>Script Output</h2>
			 <script src="js/lab.js"></script>
	 </div>
	 <img id="highway19" src="img/highway19.jpg">
